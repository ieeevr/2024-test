1425,ConeSpeech: Exploring Directional Speech Interaction for Multi-Person Remote Communication in Virtual Reality,"Yan, Yukang",yanyukanglwy@gmail.com,"We present ConeSpeech, a virtual reality (VR) based multi-user remote communication technique, which enables users to selectively speak to target listeners without distracting bystanders. With ConeSpeech, the user looks at the target listener and only in a cone-shaped area in the direction can the listeners hear the speech. We conducted a user study to determine the modality to control the cone-shaped delivery area. Then we implemented the technique and evaluated its performance in three typical multi-user communication tasks by comparing it to two baseline methods. Results show that ConeSpeech balanced the convenience and flexibility of voice communication.","Yukang Yan: Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China HCII, CMU, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States; Haohua Liu: Cornell Tech, Cornell University, New York City, New York, United States, hl766@cornell.edu; Yingtian Shi: Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China; Jingying Wang: University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States; Ruici Guo: International School, Beijing University of Post and Telecommunication, Beijing, China; Zisu Li: IIP (Computational Media and Arts), The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong SAR, Hong Kong, China, zlihe@connect.ust.hk; Xuhai Xu: Information School, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, United States; Chun Yu: Department of Computer science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China; Yuntao Wang: Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China; Yuanchun Shi: Department of Computer science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China",
