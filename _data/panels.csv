PP,Plenary Panel,"Revisiting ""What's Real about Virtual Reality?""","Tuesday, March 28, 2023",09:30,10:45,Shanghai UTC+8,"IEEE VR 2023 is the 30th conference in the series, and 2023 is the 24th anniversary of the publication of Professor Frederick P. Brooks, Jr.'s paper ""What's Real about Virtual Reality?"". In light of those two things, and acknowledging the contribution the paper has made, We propose a panel of people who engage in activities using VR/AR outside of laboratory settings; people who confront, on a daily basis, what's real (and what's not) about virtual reality. Our four panelists will each briefly describe their application and use of VR and then address the pain point--the squeaky wheel--that impedes wider adoption in their application area. The presentations will be followed by Q&A both amongst the panelists and from the audience. Audience questions will be pre-screened. The panel will be recorded for archival purposes.","Evan Suma Rosenberg: University of Minnesota, USA","Elizabeth Baron: Unity Technologies Inc., USA; Jingwen Dai: Ximmerse, China;Sharif Razzaque: Medtronic, USA;",remote | hybrid,Room A
P1,Panel 1,Advancing Interactions in XR: Exploring New Input Technologies for the Metaverse,"Monday, March 27, 2023",13:30,14:30,Shanghai UTC+8,"The world of virtual and augmented reality is rapidly evolving, but one challenge that remains is how users interact with these immersive environments. While current options like controllers and hand tracking have limitations, this panel will explore the latest advancements in input technology for XR. With a focus on new peripherals and precision hand tracking methods, experts will discuss how these technologies can enhance the user experience in the metaverse. This panel will also delve into the implications of these advancements for the development of XR and the potential to shape the way we interact with virtual worlds. Join this insightful discussion to learn about the cutting-edge advancements in input technology for XR and their impact on the future of virtual and augmented reality.","Salar Shahna: Sensoryx, Switzerland","Rolf Adelsberger: Sensoryx, Switzerland;Wen Shen: Lenovo, China",in person,Room A
P3,Panel 3,Standards for Virtual Reality,"Wednesday, March 29, 2023",08:30,09:30,Shanghai UTC+8,"The panel will offer an opportunity to bring up any standards related challenges currently not being addressed by the community.

P2,Panel 2,Can a visual design and game approach for VR increase engagement with health issues?,"Tuesday, March 28, 2023",14:00,15:00,Shanghai UTC+8,"In this panel, experts from the field of medicine, animation studies, and game design will come together in conversation to address the question of whether taking an approach to health issues that makes use of creative visual design and gamification can increase patient engagement and education, and lead to real-life behavioral changes. Particular attention will be paid to an ongoing project to develop an immersive VR experience to enhance patients’ knowledge. The panel will reflect on how bringing together theories drawn from medical science, technology, and the arts can help to construct a framework in which to consider the creation of animated gamified VR experiences for tackling health issues. Three panelists will offer diverse perspectives: stylized animation and non-photorealistic rendering (NPR); VR design for health behavior changes, and narrative construction and gamification.","Hannes Rall: Nanyang Technological University, Singapore","Hannes Rall: Nanyang Technological University, Singapore;Gray Hodgkinson: Nanyang Technological University, Singapore;Sabrina Wong: National Healthcare Group, Singapore",hybrid," Room A"
P4,Panel 4,Challenges and Opportunities of XR Applications for High-Risk Incidents,"Wednesday, March 29, 2023",14:00,15:00,Shanghai UTC+8,"XR technology has the potential to enable more effective training and incident response, revolutionizing the way we approach high risk incidents and safety. However, simply using technology for technology’s sake does not necessarily add value. Challenges must be overcome and XR applications must be well designed in tandem with subject-matter experts in order to offer true value. This panel presentation will provide an in-depth look at the current state of XR technology and its potential for enhancing safety training, improving incident response, and mitigating risks in high-risk industries. Through sharing case studies and expert perspectives, the panel will provide valuable insights on the benefits and challenges of using XR technology in these contexts. It will provide a valuable opportunity for the audience to learn about the latest developments in using XR technology for the most severe use cases where lives are on the line.","Brad Waid: New Horizons Global, USA","Jason Jerald: NextGen Interactions, USA;Scott Ledgerwood: National Institute of Standards and Technology, Public Safety Communications Research, USA;Regis Kopper: University of North Carolina Greensboro, USA/Portugal;Jeremy Keniski: XAlter, USA;Joseph Van Harken: MindSpring, USA",remote,Room A
