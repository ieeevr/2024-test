keynote-gao,Wen Gao,"Pengcheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, China","Immersive Video Reality -- Technology, Standard and Application","Tuesday, 28 March, 2023",Morning,,UTC+8,"Due to recent advances and convergence of image processing, broadband network, XR displaying device, and deep learning, immersive video reality has become a topic of great interest in recent years. Compared with traditional 2D video display, immersive video reality aims to give people new interactive and telepresence experience: from traditional single view to free viewpoint, from traditional passive viewing to active interaction with scenes, and from traditional single view intelligence to free-view intelligence. Immersive video reality is one of the core technologies in the era of the metaverse, which is going to have a great impact on television broadcasting, telecommunication, online education, telemedicine and other related industries. In this talk, we will first review the recent advances of immersive video reality technologies; then introduce the progresses of immersive video reality standardization; and present the contributions of our team in this area, especially the design of complete practical system covering real-time immersive video reality capture, coding, streaming, and displaying, which has been applied in 2022 Beijing Olympic Games.","<p>Wen Gao is the director of Pengcheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, China. He is also a Boya Chair Professor, and director at the Faculty of Information and Engineering Sciences, Peking University.

He has joined the Peking University as a professor since 2006.</p><p>Prof. Gao works in the areas of multimedia and computer vision, including video coding, video analysis, multimedia retrieval, face recognition, multimodal interfaces, and virtual reality. His most cited contributions are model-based video coding and face recognition. He published six books and over 1100 technical articles in refereed journals and proceedings in above areas. He earned many awards including seven State Awards in Science and Technology Achievements as the first accomplisher. He was featured by IEEE Spectrum in June 2005 as one of the ""Ten-To-Watch"" among China's leading technologists. He is a Fellow of IEEE, a Fellow of ACM, and a member of Chinese Academy of Engineering.</p>",http://ieeevr.org/2023/assets/images/keynotes/keynote-gao.jpeg,
keynote-lin,Ming C. Lin,University of Maryland at College Park,Reconstructing Reality:  From Physical World to Virtual Environments,"Tuesday, 28 March, 2023",Banquet,,UTC+8,"<p>With increasing availability of data in various forms from images, audio, video, 3D models, motion capture, simulation results, to satellite imagery, representative samples of the various phenomena constituting the world around us bring new opportunities and research challenges. Such availability of data has led to recent advances in data-driven modeling.  However, most of the existing example-based synthesis methods offer empirical models and data reconstruction that may not provide an insightful understanding of the underlying process or may be limited to a subset of observations. </p><p>In this talk, I present recent advances that integrate classical model-based methods and statistical learning techniques to tackle challenging problems that have not been previously addressed.   These include flow reconstruction for traffic visualization, learning heterogeneous crowd behaviors from video, simultaneous estimation of deformation and elasticity parameters from images and video, and example-based multimodal display for VR systems.  These approaches offer new insights for understanding complex collective behaviors, developing better models for complex dynamical systems from captured data, delivering more effective medical diagnosis and treatment, as well as cyber-manufacturing of customized apparel.  I conclude by discussing some possible future directions and challenges.</p>","<p>Ming C. Lin is currently Distinguished University Professor, Dr. Barry Mersky and Capital One E-Nnovate Endowed Professor, former Elizabeth Stevinson Iribe Chair of Computer Science at the University of Maryland College Park, and John R. & Louise S.

keynote-shum,Harry Shum,Xiaobing.ai,Creating Virtual AI Beings,"Wednesday, 29 March, 2023",Morning,,UTC+8,"From Apple's Siri to Amazon's Alexa to Microsoft's Cortana, today we human beings are increasingly sharing the world with AI beings. Eventually, the population of AI beings will be many times more than that of humans. In this talk, I will present some challenges and opportunities in creating AI beings: realism, interaction and embodiment. In particular, I will focus on how we can massively scale up content creation for photorealistic AI beings. For instance, how to make results controllable? How to cross the uncanny valley? How to democratize the creation process? I will show many results using the latest neural rendering technology for creating realistic AI beings. Finally, I will use an example of creating virtual singers to illustrate the state-of-the-art AI beings currently available in the social media and on the market.","Dr. Shum is the Chairman of Xiaobing.ai.
