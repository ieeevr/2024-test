keynote-lin,Ming C. Lin,University of Maryland at College Park,Reconstructing Reality:  From Physical World to Virtual Environments,"Tuesday, 28 March, 2023",18:00,19:00,CCT UTC+8,"<p>With increasing availability of data in various forms from images, audio, video, 3D models, motion capture, simulation results, to satellite imagery, representative samples of the various phenomena constituting the world around us bring new opportunities and research challenges. Such availability of data has led to recent advances in data-driven modeling.  However, most of the existing example-based synthesis methods offer empirical models and data reconstruction that may not provide an insightful understanding of the underlying process or may be limited to a subset of observations. </p><p>In this talk, I present recent advances that integrate classical model-based methods and statistical learning techniques to tackle challenging problems that have not been previously addressed.   These include flow reconstruction for traffic visualization, learning heterogeneous crowd behaviors from video, simultaneous estimation of deformation and elasticity parameters from images and video, and example-based multimodal display for VR systems.  These approaches offer new insights for understanding complex collective behaviors, developing better models for complex dynamical systems from captured data, delivering more effective medical diagnosis and treatment, as well as cyber-manufacturing of customized apparel.  I conclude by discussing some possible future directions and challenges.</p>","<p>Ming C. Lin is currently Distinguished University Professor, Dr. Barry Mersky and Capital One E-Nnovate Endowed Professor, former Elizabeth Stevinson Iribe Chair of Computer Science at the University of Maryland College Park, and John R. & Louise S.

Eventually, the population of AI beings will be many times more than that of humans. In this talk, I will present some challenges and opportunities in creating AI beings: realism, interaction and embodiment. In particular, I will focus on how we can massively scale up content creation for photorealistic AI beings. For instance, how to make results controllable? How to cross the uncanny valley? How to democratize the creation process? I will show many results using the latest neural rendering technology for creating realistic AI beings. Finally, I will use an example of creating virtual singers to illustrate the state-of-the-art AI beings currently available in the social media and on the market.","Dr. Shum is the Chairman of Xiaobing.ai.
