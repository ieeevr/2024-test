VHCIE,8th workshop on Virtual Humans and Crowds in Immersive Environments (VHCIE),,,,"Today, many tools, including algorithms and systems, are available to create and design believable virtual humans and crowds in immersive virtual environments (IVEs). Sophisticated crowd simulations can efficiently populate city-sized environments with thousands of realistic virtual characters, called virtual agents, interacting with each other and with users. A wide range of applications and scenarios can be envisioned, ranging from virtual tour guides to the creation of virtual platforms for training professionals or studying human behavior, or even the reproduction of a concert. However, several challenges are still open concerning the multimodal representation of interactions (haptic representation of physical collisions, sound, ...), the responsiveness of virtual humans to the user at the verbal and non-verbal communication levels or understanding the impact of individual and situational factors in social interactions in populated environments. The goal of the VHCIE workshop is to generate discussions on the latest research related to these issues in a cross-community approach, including research from the VR community, but more broadly, research that contributes to the understanding and simulation of human behavior during social interactions. This year, VHCIE 2024 also aims to be more inclusive, giving students the opportunity to present their ongoing projects and questions in a dedicated informal mentoring session. This will encourage constructive comments to improve their work in a supportive environment.",Anne-Helene Olivier,http://files.inria.fr/vhcie/2024,

TrainingXR,5th Annual Workshop on 3D Content Creation for Simulated Training in eXtended Reality,,,,"This workshop discusses and articulates research visions on using the latest extended reality (VR/AR/MR) technologies for education and training purposes, and on creating immersive 3D virtual content for delivering effective and personalized training experiences. This workshop will gather researchers and practitioners in a variety of computer disciplines related to XR training and content creation. This workshop will accept research papers on these topics. We will also invite renowned speakers from the research community and the industry to give talks related to XR-based training to inspire the field to further explore this promising direction.",Rawan Alghofaili,https://sites.google.com/view/trainingxrieeevr2024/trainingxr,rawan@utdallas.edu

-,Archiving VR,,,,"Virtual reality is already over 50 years old. While consumers are now appreciating modern devices that are easy to use, this workshop will celebrate some of the pioneering work that brought us to this point. We are interested in demonstrating, and starting to archive in more detail, not just the hardware, but the experiences that older VR systems presented. Thus, while one can see pictures of old, often cumbersome, head-mounted displays, we feel that there is a need to preserve video, or ideally immersive experiences, of these systems to convey the trajectory of research. That is, we want to explore what was engaging about these immersive experiences, and why they inspired such a wide variety of research and media interest.
The goal of the workshop is thus to bring together people interested in the problem of preserving the best possible media about these systems.",Anthony Steed,https://sites.google.com/view/archivingvr2024/,a.steed@ucl.ac.uk
XRIOS,International Workshop on eXtended Reality for Industrial and Occupational Supports,,,,"This workshop——eXtended Reality for Industrial and Occupational Supports (XRIOS)-aims to identify the current state of XR research and the gaps in the scope of human factors and ergonomics, mainly related to the industrial and occupational tasks, and discuss potential future research directions. XRIOS will build a community that bridges XR developers, human factors and ergonomics researchers interested in industrial and occupational applications.",Isaac Cho,https://sites.google.com/view/xrios,isaac.cho@usu.edu
IDEATExR,"Third Workshop on Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, Accessibility, Transparency, and Ethics in XR",,,,"IEEEVR and ISMAR are premier venues for mixed reality (XR) research that converges hundreds of researchers across disciplines and spectrums of research that includes both technical and human aspects of XR. However, at IEEEVR only 15% of first paper authors are women, and further, approximately 95% of the global population is excluded from VR research resulting in poor generalizability. In addition, Ethics informing XR research has been identified as one of the grand challenges facing human-computer interaction research today, with the replication crisis featuring transparency as a critical step for remediation. These factors make formal discussions surrounding inclusion, diversity, equity, accessibility, transparency, and ethics in XR not only timely, but necessary.",Lee Lisle,https://ideatexr.carrd.co/,llisle@vt.edu

LocXR,1st Workshop on Locomotion and Wayfinding in XR,,,,"This Workshop on Locomotion and Wayfinding in XR is intended to initiate novel and deepen existing discussions between researchers and practitioners interested in the broad area of navigation in extended reality. While navigation is one of the most fundamental forms of user interaction required in almost every XR application, existing research still leaves a plethora of open research questions regarding the conceptual design, technical realization, and systematic evaluation of navigation interfaces for particular use cases. In addition, a growing challenge for the research community is the reproducibility of existing interfaces and evaluations, where recent meta-analyses have shown deficiencies in terms of the descriptions of experimental setups, the scientific rigor of the underlying research processes, and the generalizability of results.",Daniel Zielasko,https://sites.google.com/view/xr-locomotion-and-wayfinding,

MASSXR,2nd Workshop on Multi-modal Affective and Social Behavior Analysis and Synthesis in Extended Reality,,,,"The 2nd MASSXR Workshop explores the intersection of immersive technologies and social-affective computing, with a focus on the advances and challenges in creating truly user-aware interaction systems within XR environments. The objective is to bring together a diverse group of researchers and practitioners from fields like AI, 3D computer vision/graphics, computer animation, and social-affective computing. The workshop aims to discuss the current state, future directions, challenges, and opportunities in developing immersive embodied intelligence. We believe that the workshop will continue providing collaboration opportunities for researchers and set the stage for future innovations in social XR.",Funda Durupinar,https://sites.google.com/view/massxrworkshop2024/,funda.durupinarbabur@umb.edu

xrWORKS,1st Workshop on Extended Reality for Knowledge Work,,,,"The 1st Workshop on Extended Reality for Knowledge Work (xrWORKS) aims to bring together researchers interested in using extended reality technologies for supporting knowledge work. This workshop aims to create a space where both academic and industry researchers can discuss their experiences and visions to continue growing the impact of XR in the future of work. Through a combination of position papers, in-person demonstrations, and a brainstorming session, we aim to reach a more complete understanding of the space and debate future research agenda. ""KnowledgeWork"" follows the definition initially coined by Drucker (1966) where information workers apply theoretical and analytical knowledge to develop products and services. Much of the work might be detached from physical documents, artifacts, or specific work locations and is mediated through digital devices such as laptops. Workers include architects, engineers, scientists, design thinkers, public accountants, lawyers, and academics, whose job is to ""think for a living"".",Leonardo Pavanatto,https://sites.google.com/view/xrworks,xrworks@googlegroups.com
