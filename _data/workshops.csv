VHCIE,8th workshop on Virtual Humans and Crowds in Immersive Environments (VHCIE),,,,"Today, many tools, including algorithms and systems, are available to create and design believable virtual humans and crowds in immersive virtual environments (IVEs). Sophisticated crowd simulations can efficiently populate city-sized environments with thousands of realistic virtual characters, called virtual agents, interacting with each other and with users. A wide range of applications and scenarios can be envisioned, ranging from virtual tour guides to the creation of virtual platforms for training professionals or studying human behavior, or even the reproduction of a concert. However, several challenges are still open concerning the multimodal representation of interactions (haptic representation of physical collisions, sound, ...), the responsiveness of virtual humans to the user at the verbal and non-verbal communication levels or understanding the impact of individual and situational factors in social interactions in populated environments. The goal of the VHCIE workshop is to generate discussions on the latest research related to these issues in a cross-community approach, including research from the VR community, but more broadly, research that contributes to the understanding and simulation of human behavior during social interactions. This year, VHCIE 2024 also aims to be more inclusive, giving students the opportunity to present their ongoing projects and questions in a dedicated informal mentoring session. This will encourage constructive comments to improve their work in a supportive environment.",Anne-Helene Olivier,http://files.inria.fr/vhcie/2024

LocXR,1st Workshop on Locomotion and Wayfinding in XR,,,,"This Workshop on Locomotion and Wayfinding in XR is intended to initiate novel and deepen existing discussions between researchers and practitioners interested in the broad area of navigation in extended reality. While navigation is one of the most fundamental forms of user interaction required in almost every XR application, existing research still leaves a plethora of open research questions regarding the conceptual design, technical realization, and systematic evaluation of navigation interfaces for particular use cases. In addition, a growing challenge for the research community is the reproducibility of existing interfaces and evaluations, where recent meta-analyses have shown deficiencies in terms of the descriptions of experimental setups, the scientific rigor of the underlying research processes, and the generalizability of results.",Daniel Zielasko,https://sites.google.com/view/xr-locomotion-and-wayfinding

xrWORKS,1st Workshop on Extended Reality for Knowledge Work,,,,"The 1st Workshop on Extended Reality for Knowledge Work (xrWORKS) aims to bring together researchers interested in using extended reality technologies for supporting knowledge work. This workshop aims to create a space where both academic and industry researchers can discuss their experiences and visions to continue growing the impact of XR in the future of work. Through a combination of position papers, in-person demonstrations, and a brainstorming session, we aim to reach a more complete understanding of the space and debate future research agenda.",Leonardo Pavanatto,https://sites.google.com/view/xrworks
