<h3>About this Tutorial</h3>
<p>
    Several researchers in our field are expressing concern regarding the increased amount of paper reviews they are asked to provide. This is backed up by the <a href="https://clarivate.com/lp/global-state-of-peer-review-report/">2018 Publons Global State of Peer Review (GSPR) report</a>, which shows that the number of requested reviews is outpacing the available reviewers while reviewer fatigue is on the rise. A critical finding was the need for formal training so that newer researchers can enter the peer-reviewer pool earlier and more confidently. This responsibility is often pushed onto students’ advisors, but only 16.1% of the GSRP survey respondents were asked by their supervisor or PI to write a review with them or on their behalf. Furthermore, 39.4% of respondents had never had formal peer-review training. 88% of respondents believe that formal peer-reviewer training is either important or very important for producing high-quality reviews, and 80% respond that formal peer-reviewer training would have either a positive or extremely positive outcome on the peer-review system. It is clear that the research community at large believes that more peer-review training is important, and this tutorial is an attempt to provide it, in part, to this research community.
</p>
<h3>Intended Audience</h3>
<p>
    There will be no technical aspect of the tutorial, so there is no required technical level for participants. The intended audience is persons relatively new to research who will likely find themselves participating in the peer-review process. Specifically, the content will be targeted at junior researchers, including Ph.D. students, but everyone should find something useful in the content.
</p>
<h3>Expected Value for the Audience</h3>
<p>
    The expected value for the audience is twofold. First, participants will have a greater understanding of the peer-review process and how to construct a quality review. With this knowledge, they should be able to enter the peer-reviewer pool earlier than they would otherwise, increasing their visibility to our community. Second, as we increase the size of the peer-reviewer pool, participants will hopefully see a more manageable number of review requests in the future, reducing the chances of reviewer fatigue.
</p>
<h3>Topics Outline</h3>
<p>
The tutorial will be broken into three, one-hour-long sections. First, there will be an introduction and an instructional presentation. The second hour will consist of hands-on and interactive activities aimed at helping participants understand the core components of quality reviews. Finally, we will conclude the tutorial with a panel made up of senior researchers in the field, of whom participants will get the opportunity to ask questions regarding the review process.
