    <h2>About IEEE VR 2024</h2>
    <p>
        IEEE VR 2024, the 31<sup>st</sup> IEEE Conference on Virtual Reality and 3D User Interfaces will be held from March 16th through March 21th, 2024 at the Contemporary Resort, Walt Disney World, Orlando, Florida.
    </p>

    <p>
        Our goal is to provide the best hybrid conference experience for physical and virtual attendees,  learning from the historical footsteps of the successful physical or virtual experience of <a href={{ "/past-conferences/" | relative_url }}>past IEEE VR conferences</a>. 
        Considering the possible time difference between on-site and online participants, we introduce a new <b>double-time mode</b> to the conference that <b style="color: black;">records the live paper sessions and replays them after 12 hours so that online participants may attend the conference at their convenient time anywhere on earth</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Come join us for an unforgettable experience and explore the virtuality continuum in the premier event covering extended reality 
        featuring oral presentations, posters, research demos, tutorials, and workshops.
