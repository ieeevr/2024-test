    <p class = "ieeevrmsgbox bold alignCenter">
        IEEE VR 2024 is coming back full, in-person to Orlando, Florida, USA<br />
        from March 16th to March 20th, 2024
    </p>
    <p>
        We are preparing a strong in-person comeback for the premier Virtual Reality and 3D User Interfaces event at the intersection of technology, creativity, and science. 
    </p>
    <p>
        We anticipate the IEEE VR will be a special event that will bring us all back together after the challenging pandemic years to present our innovative research, experience new advances in VR and 3D interfaces, and catch up with what's happening with our community.  Come and join us for exciting presentations featuring research papers, workshops and tutorials in current VR and 3D interfaces topics, research demos on innovative techniques and applications, and posters about upcoming work.

    <h2>About the IEEE VR Conference</h2>
    <p>
        The IEEE Conference on Virtual Reality and 3D User Interfaces (IEEE VR) is the premier international event for the presentation of research results in the broad areas of virtual, augmented, and mixed reality (VR/AR/MR). Since 1993, IEEE VR has presented groundbreaking research and accomplishments by virtual reality pioneers: scientists, engineers, designers, and artists, paving the way for the future. Soon, IEEE VR expanded its scope to also include augmented, mixed, and other forms of mediated reality. Similarly, the IEEE Symposium on 3D User Interfaces (3DUI), which started as a workshop at IEEE VR in 2004, has become the premier venue for 3D user interfaces and 3D interaction in virtual environments.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 2018, VR and 3DUI were merged into the IEEE Conference on Virtual Reality and 3D User Interfaces, with the short name IEEE VR. In 2020, VR was the first major IEEE conference to be held entirely online and in a virtual environment.
