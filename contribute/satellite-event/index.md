    <h2 id="overview"> Overview </h2>
    <p>
        We invite proposals for satellite events since the potential travel restrictions could make it inconvenient for some registered members to travel to Shanghai. Members are encouraged to organize satellite events to provide more networking opportunities for our community. Accepted Satellite Events will be advertised on the IEEE VR 2024 website by their location, contact information, and link to the organizersâ€™ website.
    </p>

    <h2 id="guideline"> Submission Guidelines</h2>
    <p>
        Proposals for satellite events should be submitted electronically to  <span class="general"></span> and should include:
        <ul>
        <li>A brief description (500 words or less) of the satellite event (location, time, the maximum number of attendances, etc.)</li>
        <li>The names, contact information, and short (100 words or less) biographies for the organizers.</li>
        </ul>
        To mention that, the organization and all costs incurred are under the full responsibility of the organizers of the Satellite Event.
    </p>
