    <h2 id="overview"> Overview </h2>
    <p>
        We invite proposals for satellite events since the potential travel restrictions could make it inconvenient for some registered members to travel to Shanghai. Members are encouraged to organize satellite events to provide more networking opportunities for our community. Accepted Satellite Events will be advertised on the IEEE VR 2024 website by their location, contact information, and link to the organizersâ€™ website.
    </p>
