    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
    <p>
        As a community, we understand that video-based content is an important way to communicate ideas. As such, we invite VR/AR researchers, industry professionals, and enthusiasts to submit videos showcasing VR/AR research, applications, researchers/labs, and other creative work. Submitted videos should either be concerning VR/AR research and application or be designed for consumption in a VR format. This year there are three video submission tracks, including the Technical Video track and the Creative VR track from previous years, and a new Lightning Introductions track. Topics and requirements for each track are detailed below. Accepted video submissions will be featured during the conference and on the IEEE Virtual Reality Conference <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ieeevrconf">YouTube Channel</a>.
    </p>

    <h2 id="Lightning-Introductions-Track">Lightning Introductions Track</h2>
    <p>
        This year, we want to provide new researchers, faculty, and professionals the opportunity to introduce themselves or their lab to the IEEE VR community. Inspired by the ISMAR “Pitch Your Lab” track and the UIST “Lightning Introductions” track, the objective is to provide a platform for incoming community members to advertise and share their research. Like the other video tracks, Lightning Introductions will be presented during the conference. We will feature a playlist with all accepted submissions on the IEEE VR website, including the author's contact information.
    </p>

    <p>
    Attendees should submit a one to two page abstract  that includes:
    <ul>
        <li>
            a short bio or lab description
        </li>
        <li>
            research interests
        </li>
        <li>
            motivation to present a lightning talk (e.g., networking or job search)
        </li>
        <li>
            contact information
        </li>
        <li>

    <p>
        Submissions to the Creative VR track should be artistic, creative, experimental, narrative, or journalistic in nature and produced in a 360-degree spherical format. Audio-visual immersion and user participation can heighten a viewer’s sense of presence and level of engagement with a presentation form closer to how we perceive and engage with the world around us. Production might be live-action, CGI Omni-directional rendering, visual FX compositing, etc., we are interested in originality and innovation in the design of immersive experiences. The video should also include a title slide at its beginning detailing the title, authors, and affiliations (similar to a typical presentation title slide). Accepted videos will also be prominently displayed during the IEEE Virtual Reality conference.
    </p>

        </li>
        <li>
            Titles and credits should not be displayed for more than ten seconds each; the content is the most important part of the video!
        </li>
        <li>
            Please follow the YouTube recommended encoding settings (for frame rate and bitrate): <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1722171">https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1722171</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            English subtitles must be included. Youtube will auto-generate these for you, but you should verify that they are correct.
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>360° Videos:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Format: Spherical/equirectangular 360-degree format in monoscopic or stereoscopic 3D (top-bottom layout with left on top).</li>

        </li>
        <li>Aspect ratio is 2:1 for mono or 1:1 for stereoscopic 3D (top-bottom). The recommended horizontal resolution is 4k. YouTube recommends a 16:9 aspect ratio, but the correct 2:1 aspect ratio for spherical projection seems to work as well and is preferred.</li>
        <li>Spatial audio is possible within the YouTube specification (1st order ambisonic): <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6395969">https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6395969</a></li>
