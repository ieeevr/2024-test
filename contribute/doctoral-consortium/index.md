    <h2 id="Overview">Overview</h2>
    <p>
        The DC is a concentrated full-day event that will be held on March 12, where students present their
        research interests/plans/results to a panel of researchers in the field and receive specific
        constructive feedback, including opportunities to meet with mentors one-on-one. Accepted students
        will be expected to give in-depth presentations of their research and will receive constructive
        comments from mentors. Additionally, accepted students will create a poster about their work to
        allow IEEE VR attendees to quickly familiarize themselves with each other’s work and to be shown
        to a broader audience during the conference poster session. Accepted students will have the option
        to publish their two-page extended abstract in the conference proceedings and to be included in the
        online IEEE VR program. There is also the possibility that the abstracts may be archived in the
        IEEExplore digital library.
    </p>

    <h2 id="Eligibility-and-topics">Eligibility and Topics</h2>
    <p>
        Ideal candidates will be in the early or mid-stages of their PhD and should have a solid idea of their
        direction and topic, but should also have room for improvement. The DC welcomes applicants from a
        broad range of disciplines including VR, AR, 3D user interfaces, human-computer interaction,
        wearable computing, social informatics, information technology, cognitive science, and related fields.
    </p>

    <h2 id="submission-guidelines">Submission Guidelines</h2>
    <p>
        To apply to the DC, please submit the following two documents via the Precision Conference
        Doctoral Consortium track at <a href="https://new.precisionconference.com/~vr">https://new.precisionconference.com/~vr</a> as a single PDF. All IEEE
        VR Doctoral Consortium submissions should be prepared in IEEE Computer Society VGTC format

        <ol>
            <li>Position paper: Paper submissions should be 2 pages in length including references. This
                position paper must clearly motivate, discuss, and summarize the proposed Ph.D. research,
                describe how the research fits into and advances research in VR and/or related fields, and
                report on your progress. You may additionally focus on a more specific area of the research
                if desired. In the concluding section, you should identify 2-3 questions/areas for improvement
                that you would like to discuss during the DC.</li>

    <h2 id="financing">Financing Your Conference Travel</h2>
    <p>
        Students are encouraged to seek funding from their institutions for registration costs. DC participants
        who also apply as Student Volunteers should refer to the Student Volunteer chairs for funding
        information. Historically, the conference has been able to obtain some funding for students based in
        the U.S. and as we obtain specific information on other financial support we will update these pages
        and/or notify accepted student researchers.
