<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>
    We invite individuals or teams interested in organising such a workshop to submit proposals that will
    work well online or on-site at the conference venue for IEEE VR 2022. Since IEEE VR 2022 is going
    to be held in a hybrid mode, we encourage workshops to already consider this in their initial
    submission to maximise participation. Although longer workshops will be considered, we encourage
    shorter efficient workshops, or online workshops split over sessions spanning one or two days with
    long breaks between sessions in order to reduce video-conference fatigue and to provide attendees
    time to reflect between sessions.
</p>
<p>
    Workshops are intended to bring together researchers, developers, technology providers,
    practitioners and users for a lively and interactive discussion of issues through an informal exchange
    of ideas and information. Workshops may target a specific application area, a specific research area,
    or a topic of general interest. Workshops should be more than just a mini conference of paper
    presentations. Workshops may include, but are not limited to:
    <ul>
        <li>A focus on creating and exchanging of new ideas and opportunities to meet new people</li>
        <li>A balance of formal presentations with informal discussion and ideation</li>
        <li>Emphasis on attendee participation and interactive discussions</li>
        <li>Thought experiments and playing with ideas</li>
        <li>Curated panels</li>
        <li>Position papers</li>
        <li>Recorded sessions prepared in advance of the conference for attendees to watch at their
            convenience before live workshop discussion</li>
        <li>VR experiences for attendees to try remotely before live workshop discussion</li>
        <li>Live application development by both speakers and attendees</li>
        <li>Inclusive VR and geographical diversity</li>
        <li>Creative ways of supporting participation across different time zones</li>
        <li>Breakout groups and presentation of ideas generated by the groups</li>
        <li>A summary session concluding with lessons learned, insights gained, and new ideas
            generated from the workshop</li>
        <li>Continued discussion after the conference.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    The deadline for workshop proposals and CFP submissions is Wednesday, December 1, 2021.
    Notifications of results will be sent out on Thursday, December 9, 2021. Accepted workshop
    CFPs may be posted and publicised.
</p>

<p>
    If accepted, workshop organisers are expected to distribute their CFP and announce the
    workshops through their professional networks. As listed in the Workshops CFP submission,
    workshop organisers are required to provide a workshop website and are expected to update
    that website as workshop details become better defined.
</p>

<p>
    Workshop organisers are expected to issue any acceptance decisions to their contributors no
    later than Thursday, January 20, 2022, in order to allow sufficient time for planning and advance
    registration to the conference. IEEE VR Workshops proceedings will be published electronically
    through the IEEE Digital Library dependent on the on-time submission of the proceedings by the
    workshop organisers, before the mandatory IEEE deadline of Saturday, January 29, 2022.
    Organisers of accepted workshops are encouraged to seek assistance from the Workshops
    Chairs to navigate this process.
