    <h2 id="Overview">Overview</h2>
    <p>
        The 31<sup>st</sup> IEEE Conference on Virtual Reality and 3D User Interfaces 2024 seeks poster submissions, which describe recently completed work, highly relevant results of work in progress, or successful systems and applications, in all areas related to virtual reality, augmented reality, mixed reality, and 3D user interfaces.
    </p>
    <p>
        Presenting a poster is a great way to get feedback on work that has not yet been published. As the conference will be a hybrid, likely both a remote and in-person poster presentation will be part of the conference, with sessions for interactive discussion between presenters and attendees for at least two days where authors can orally present a brief summary of their work to all conference attendees. Note that, in order to maintain interactive and exciting poster presentations, we require at least one presenter per accepted poster to attend the conference virtually or in person.
 </p>

    <p>
    It is currently not decided which online platform will be used for the online part of the conference. We are aware of the fact that this is of vital interest, especially for poster presenters, and will inform all authors as soon as we have more information.
    </p>
    
    <h2 id="submission-guidelines">Submission Guidelines</h2>
    <p>
        Submissions to the poster track must be written in English. The submission must be in the form of a two-page summary paper (references included) with a maximum of 100-word abstract. The submitted paper must be in PDF format with embedded fonts. Two-page papers will be included in the abstracts and workshop proceedings and will be archived in the IEEE Digital Library, and therefore must be formatted using the IEEE Computer Society format described at <a href="http://junctionpublishing.org/vgtc/Tasks/camera.html">http://junctionpublishing.org/vgtc/Tasks/camera.html</a>. 
        Poster papers must be submitted through a particular poster track available at the online submission site - 
        <a href="https://new.precisionconference.com/submissions">https://new.precisionconference.com/submissions</a>. Supplemental materials, such as a video or image, can be uploaded to the submission site as well, but are not mandatory. Every submission should be anonymous for a peer-review process.
