    <h2 id="Overview">Overview</h2>
    <p>
        The 29th IEEE Conference on Virtual Reality and 3D User Interfaces 2022 seeks research demonstrations from laboratories 
        or research groups (academic, government, or industry). Demos should interest the broad XR community and be presentable 
        in a conference setting exhibiting new and innovative work. The conference will provide basic infrastructure. Additionally, 
        authors of accepted demos will present an overview in a fast-forward research demonstration session to summarize their demo 
        and relate it to research being performed at their lab.
    </p>


    <h2 id="submission-guidelines">Submission Guidelines</h2>
    <p>
        A demo proposal should include:
        <ul>
            <li>
                A two-page extended abstract in PDF format describing the demo and the research itself. This will be published in 
                the conference proceedings. Please provide the abstract in IEEE format, see below.
            </li>
            <li>
                A 3-5 minute instructional video that walks viewers through the research project and showcases the demo in action. 
                Please provide an accessible URL in the submission. A YouTube or Vimeo link is highly recommended. If accepted, we 
                plan to use the video as something attendees can view asynchronously.
            </li>
            <li>
                The conference will be a virtual event and we would like to provide attendees an immersive experience of the research 
                demo. As such, we ask that you write a 2-3 line short description separate from the extended abstract on how you would 
                present your research demo remotely in an immersive way. For example, setting up a Mozilla Hubs room with a 3D replica 
                of your prototype, so attendees can interact with it. Please note that this is not a requirement for the submission and 
                will not affect the decision, but is highly recommended.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        The submission materials should clearly describe the overall architecture of the system or technology demonstrated. Authors 
        should put emphasis on the work's motivation, applications, novelty, and research direction. Submissions need not be anonymized 
        but may be if the authors prefer. Abstracts for accepted demos will be included in the conference proceedings and in the IEEE 
        Xplore Digital Library, so they must follow the IEEE Computer Society format at 
        <a href="http://junctionpublishing.org/vgtc/Tasks/camera.html">http://junctionpublishing.org/vgtc/Tasks/camera.html</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please note that authors will be asked to do live presentations and/or demos on certain days of the conference. The days and 
        time slots for the live presentations will be determined after the review process is complete. More details about this will 
        be posted on this page later.
