    <h2 id="Overview">Overview</h2>
    <p>
        The 31<sup>st</sup> IEEE Conference on Virtual Reality and 3D User Interfaces 2024 seeks research demonstrations from laboratories or research groups (academic, government, or industry). Demos should interest the broad XR community and be presentable in a conference setting exhibiting new and innovative work. The conference will provide basic infrastructure. Additionally, authors of accepted demos will present an overview in a fast-forward research demonstration session to summarize their demo and relate it to research being performed at their lab.
    </p>

    <h2 id="submission-guidelines">Submission Guidelines</h2>
    <p>
        A demo proposal should include:
        <ul>
            <li>
                A two-page extended abstract in PDF format describing the demo and the research itself. This will be published in the abstract and workshop proceedings. Please provide the abstract in IEEE format, see below.
            </li>
            <li>
                A 3-5 minute instructional video that walks viewers through the research project and showcases the demo in action. Please provide an accessible URL in the submission. A YouTube or Vimeo link is highly recommended. If accepted, we plan to use the video as something attendees can view asynchronously.
            </li>
            <li>
                The conference will be a hybrid event and we would like to provide attendees an immersive experience of the research demo. As such, we ask that you write a 2-3 line short description separate from the extended abstract on how you would present your research demo remotely in an immersive way. For example, setting up a Mozilla Hubs room with a 3D replica of your prototype, so attendees can interact with it. Please note that this is not a requirement for the submission and will not affect the decision, but is highly recommended.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        The submission materials should clearly describe the overall architecture of the system or technology demonstrated. Authors should put emphasis on the work's motivation, applications, novelty, and research direction. Submissions need not be anonymized but may be if the authors prefer. Abstracts for accepted demos will be included in the abstract and workshop proceedings and in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library, so they must follow the IEEE Computer Society format at
        <a href="http://junctionpublishing.org/vgtc/Tasks/camera.html">http://junctionpublishing.org/vgtc/Tasks/camera.html</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please note that authors will be asked to do live presentations and/or demos on certain days of the conference. The days and time slots for the live presentations will be determined after the review process is complete. More details about this will be posted on this page later.
