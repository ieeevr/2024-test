        This year, IEEE VR will take place as a <strong>hybrid conference</strong>. You can choose to work online or on-site in Shanghai. You must be willing to work about <strong>15 to 20 hours</strong> during the conference. Furthermore, you must be available for SV orientation before the conference begins. Your SV duties will include: working the registration desk on-site, helping with the setup of the virtual or physical environment, providing assistance to speakers and attendees virtually and physically, and more. If you cannot commit yourself to this time frame and this amount of work, then please do not take away a slot from another willing student.
