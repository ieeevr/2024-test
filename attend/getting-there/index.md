     <div class="ieeevrmsgbox bold">
        <div class = "ieeevrmsgboxInside small_emphasize">
           There will be a very limited number of parking spaces available at the Contemporary Resort. Once the spots are filled, all additional cars will be turned away, causing a significant time delay for attendees.  If you are local or staying in a hotel away from the Contemporary Resort, plan on taking Disney transportation, ride shares such as Uber or Lyft, or a taxi.
        </div>
    </div>
    <p>
        Once within the Walt Disney Resort area, guests can move to the different areas via Disney complimentary transportation. See <a href="https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/guest-services/resort-transportation/" target="_blank">Disney Transportation</a> for detailed information.
        <ul>
            <li> There is a Disney bus stop right in front of the conference hotel! See <a href="https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/guest-services/bus-transportation/" target="_blank">Disney Bus Transportation</a> for more information on Disney bus service.</li>
            <li>Disney Springs has free parking and complementary bus service to the Contemporary Resort.</li>
            <li>The Magic Kingdom is only a short walk from the conference hotel down a nice pathway.  If you find it easier to get to the Magic Kingdom, you will only be a 15-minute walk away from the conference. </li>
            <li>Disney's monorail goes directly through and stops within the Contemporary Resort's hotel.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="italic">If you are staying inside the Walt Disney World area, but not at the Contemporary Resort, plan a minimum of 30-45 minutes travel time using Disney's buses or water transportation options to arrive to the Contemporary Resort. </span>
