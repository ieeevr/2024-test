<h2 id="hybrid">IEEE VR 2024 will be in hybrid mode as we planned</h2>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">
The global COVID-19 situation has become more stabilized now. International travel to China has been much more convenient since Jan. 8, 2024. The situation in China is stable and normal as usual and is good for traveling and in-person conferences.
</p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">
After three years of virtual online VR conferences, we understand that members of the VR community are expecting more face-to-face meetings and interactions. Therefore, we strongly encourage all to come to Shanghai to attend the IEEE VR 2024 conference in person. The conference committee has been working hard to organize an outstanding technical program to be presented physically in our conference venue, consisting of keynotes, papers, posters, research demos, 3DUI contests, videos, panels, workshops, tutorials, and doctoral consortiums. To provide more face-to-face networking opportunities, we have further prepared a cruise reception, banquet, industry/lab tour, and other activities for in-person participants.
</p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">
For those who cannot attend in person, we will provide live streaming of the conference and online platforms for presenting and interaction. <strong style="color:black;">Considering the possible time difference between on-site and online participants, we plan to record the live paper sessions and replay them after 12 hours (Shanghai nighttime)</strong> so that online participants may attend the paper sessions at their convenient time while communicating with authors on Slack.
</p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">
The hybrid mode conference is challenging and costly as it needs to support both in-person and online experiences, and further, we need to synchronize both. <b style="color:black;">Thus, to maintain the quality of the conference, we require an individual author registration for each accepted publication and encourage more co-authors to join the conference. </b>Meanwhile, this year’s VR attempts to reduce the price as low as possible and provides flexible options for full-week, weekend-only, and weekday-only registration types. We expect more attendees to participate either in-person or online to keep the VR community strong and contribute to the long-term health and growth of the VR conference.
</p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">
<strong>
We look forward to seeing all of you in Shanghai soon.
</strong>

<h2 id="faq">Registation FAQ</h2>
<ol>
    <li style="color: #F5725E:"><strong>How many papers/publications can be validated by one author registration?</strong><br/>
        Each registered author can validate only one paper/poster/demo/video/3DUI contest/workshop paper/tutorial/DC. <br/>For example, if you have one conference and one demo, you need a "Paper Author Registration" and a "Demo Author Registration" to validate both. In the register system, you should select <u>only one contribution each time</u>. <br/>Although mutiple "Author Registration" can be covered by one name, we encourage registrations followed by different names for promoting interactions among the community.
       <!-- <br/><strong style="color:black;">For those who don't have co-authors and need to register for more than two publications, a 50% discount will be automatically applied for the third or more registrations with the same name and email address. If the number of registrations displayed does not match the actual number, please wait a few minutes for the database to synchronize.</strong> -->
        </li> 
    <li style="color: #F5725E:"><strong>Can an author register as a "General Participant", while he/she actually presents a paper?</strong><br/>
        Yes. As long as the paper has one author registered as "Paper Author Registration" to validate the paper, another registered participant can present the paper.</li>
    <li style="color: #F5725E:"><strong>I am invited to present a paper previously published on TVCG. What category should I register as?</strong><br/>
        You should use the same category as "Paper Author Registration".</li>
    <li style="color: #F5725E:"><strong>What number should I provide to register as an invited TVCG paper author? </strong><br/>
        You should indicate your full Paper DOI, eg: 10.1109/TVCG.20nn.ddddddd (as listed on TVCG).</li>
    <li style="color: #F5725E:"><strong>What is an Invited TVCG paper?</strong><br/>
        Invited TVCG papers are those manuscripts previously published on IEEE TVCG and invited for oral presentation at the conference. Not to be confused with IEEE VR 2024 Journal Papers published in the special issue.</li>
    <li style="color: #F5725E:"><strong>Why I can't open the registration system after I clicked the register button?</strong><br/>
      It may need a few minutes to open the registration system for the first time.</li>
    <li style="color: #F5725E:"><strong>Why I can't click the "Pay" button although I have filled out the form correctly?</strong><br/>
      The "Pay" button is inactive unless the server confirms the form is filled out. Usually, the confirmation is done automaticly in a minute. For uploading a digital copy of Student ID, you may wait a couple of minutes for the server to receive the registration data.</li>
    <li style="color: #F5725E:"><strong>The guidance for the payment page:</strong><br/>
      We support a screenshot of the payment page in English <a href="http://ieeevr.org/2024/assets/attend/Instruction_PaymentPage.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</li> 
    <li style="color: #F5725E:"><strong>What is the "huge handling/service fee" mentioned on the payment page, and how much will it be? </strong><br/>
      It is an additional charge for the credit card payment. This extra charge of credit card is not charged by the university and the local bank, but by the bank of the credit card. The amount varies depending on the bank of the credit card, e.g., around 3% for some banks. The total amount will be displayed on the page of credit card payment.As the fee is not charged by us, we are unable to issue a receipt that includes this handing fee.</li> 
    <li style="color: #F5725E:"><strong>What if my credit card payment fails? </strong><br/>
      You can pay by bank transfer if the credit card payment fails. See for details about <a href="#bank_transfer">the process of bank transfer</a></li>
    <li style="color: #F5725E:" id="bank_transfer"><strong>How to pay by bank transfer? </strong><br/>
      If you need to pay by bank transfer, we hope you can first fill out <a href="https://ieeevr.org/2024/attend/registration/">the registration form on the website</a> so we can generate a unique number to manage your registration information and the invoice. This unique number is used to represent each registration order in our registration system.
      The step-by-step instruction below may make this process clearer:
      <ul>
         <li>Fill out the registration form at http://150.158.11.215:3000/register.</li>
         <li>Click the “Pay” button at the bottom of the second page of the registration form, which equals clicking a “save” button to send the information to our server. Also, you will get a unique bill number. </li>
         <li>Email <a href="mailto:register2024@ieeevr.org?subject=Bank Transfer Request">register2024@ieeevr.org</a> to ask for an invoice. Please include the unique bill number and your personal information, making it easier to find your order. We will send an invoice as soon as possible.</li>
         <li>Pay the registration fee and quote your invoice number that shows on the invoice. We will send a receipt once we confirm the bank transfer, which may cost a few days.</li>
      </ul>
